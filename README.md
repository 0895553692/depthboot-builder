# ðŸ™¼ EUPNEA

<p align="center">A way to natively boot and run <kbd><img width="25" height="30" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Tux.svg/1200px-Tux.svg.png"></img></kbd> Linux on modern Chromebooks without replacing firmware</p>

## Supported Devices

**All Chromebooks released after 2017 are supported.**

### Benefits

**Stock Ubuntu:**
* Requires a change in firmware (UEFI or Legacy Boot)
* Has everything working except touchscreen and audio

**Breath:**
* Requires no change in firmware and has all peripherals working

## Running Eupnea

<h3 align="center"><a href="https://cb-linux.github.io/breath/docs.html#/">ðŸ“„ Please visit the docs here ðŸ“„</a></h3>

## How does everything work?

This project uses the ChromeOS Kernel and firmware. Touchscreen and all other peripherals *just work*. Breath has been carefully designed to not have any legal issues, so you can't flash the ISO or have the audio firmware bundled.

Audio works [perfectly](bin/setup-audio) through ALSA, but not PulseAudio or Pipewire. All apps that use PulseAudio libraries (like Firefox) work as of [this commit](https://github.com/cb-linux/breath/commit/884bd03b8eef554bdbafd7b4d62f36690f472237). You can follow further audio progress [here](https://github.com/cb-linux/breath/projects/1).
