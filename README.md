<p align="center">An experimental way to natively run <kbd><img width="25" height="30" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Tux.svg/1200px-Tux.svg.png"></img></kbd> Linux on modern Chromebooks without replacing firmware</p>

## Supported Devices

**All Chromebooks released after 2017 are supported.**

### Benefits

**Stock Ubuntu:**
* Requires a change in firmware (UEFI or Legacy Boot)
* Has everything working except touchscreen and audio

**Breath:**
* Requires no change in firmware and has all peripherals working on my HP Chromebook 14 x360.

## Running Breath

## How does everything work?

This project uses the ChromeOS Kernel and the firmware. Touchscreen and all other peripherals *just work*. Breath has been carefully designed not to have any legal issues, so you can't flash the ISO or have the audio firmware bundled.

Audio works [perfectly](bin/setup-audio) through ALSA, but not PulseAudio or Pipewire. All apps that use PulseAudio libraries (like Firefox) work as of [this commit](https://github.com/MilkyDeveloper/cb-linux/commit/884bd03b8eef554bdbafd7b4d62f36690f472237). You can follow further audio progress [here](https://github.com/MilkyDeveloper/cb-linux/projects/1).
