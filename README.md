## Supported Devices
[Supported devices](https://eupnea-linux.github.io/docs.html#/devices)

## Eupnea vs mainline
**Stock Ubuntu:**
* Requires a change in firmware (UEFI or RW_legacy)
* Some hardware may not work(touchscreen, touchpad...) and audio is mostly unsupported.

**Eupnea:**
* Requires no change in firmware and has all peripherals working. Audio support varies.

## How does Eupnea work?
This project uses a slightly modified ChromeOS Kernel and firmware. All devices supported in ChromeOS work in Eupnea. Due to licensing restraints, Eupnea cannot be distributed as an iso. Instead, it has to be build locally on the device.
